	<BODY>
		Here are different kind of basic formats<br />
		<br />
		Heading: there are Heading 1,2,3,4,5,6<br />
		It would look like this:<br />
		<br />
		<H1>This is H1 - Heading 1</H1>
		<H2>This is H2 - Heading 2</H2>
		<H3>This is H3 - Heading 3</H3>
		<H4>This is H4 - Heading 4</H4>
		<H5>This is H5 - Heading 5</H5>
		<H6>This is H6 - Heading 6</H6>

		<br /><br />

		BR is for break line.
		If you don't use < BR /> then this line will not go under the line above.

		<br /><br />
		But if you have Break, then it will let you go to the next line<br />
		like this.
		<br /><br />

		<b>This is BOLD</b><br />

		<i>This is Italic</i><br /><br />

		<u>This is for underline</u><br /><br />

		and for paragraph, you use < P >  </ P >.  Like this <br /><br />

		<p>This is the paragraph example I am showing.  Hope you can see what it does.  A lot of automated editors would put ton of paragraph tags all over the place.</P>

		<p>And this will show how you can group your paragraphs into proper paragraph section where I don't use that often... Don't know why, but I never got use to using paragraph tag... :-\ </p>

		<p>So, what is the difference in paragraph tag?  even if you put lots of ENTERS, like this



		the paragraph tag would ignore multiple ENTERs...</p>

		<br /><br />
		
		<pre>This is pre-formatted text format.
		I use this quite often time when I want to show my code.  like this

		void static main(String[] args) {
			// put my code here
		}
		</pre>
